The goal of sparsevectors is to enable more efficient computations of sparse numeric vectors, through an S4 class. Sparse vectors are where most of the slots of the vector are zero, so having them in the format implemented instead just represents these vectors by the non-zero elements. It contains functions that perform arithmetic on sparse vectors .
